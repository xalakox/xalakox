I am a software engineer and have been around the software industry for a while now, currently living in Georgia (the country) and working full time as a ReactJS / NodeJS developer for TourConnect.

Have worked with a wide range of software stacks since the 90s, Full Stack web dev over the past 20+ years; constantly looking to challenge myself using emerging technologies, walking the walk is more valuable than talking the talk.

Industries I have worked with: Tourism, Social Media / Data Mining and Retail / E-Commerce.
